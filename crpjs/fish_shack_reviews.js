reviews = ["One word.....YUM!!!!

I always send out-of-towners to Bennett's for good food and family atmosphere.", "Almost 5 stars... Food was exceptional! We had fish tacos (more like a burrito but awesome, comes with fries) 
The wild salmon on Ceasar (generous portion, comes with clam chowder)
All you can eat smoked salmon fettuccine (soooo good) all you can eat pasta on Wednesdays!!!
So... My less one star comes because they have this amazing bar that they don't utilize. No happy hour, no karaoke, bingo, no party at all! It closes at 8pm and Ocean shores is dying for a cool night spot!
We had some of the best cocktails Ive had in a while from a bartender named bill (also awesome) but we closed the place down because it closes so early!
What a bummer! Stay open if you can, we need you!!! 
Thanks for the great food and DRINKS! :)", "A friend from Ocean Shores recommended this place to us, and it was good.  I had the salmon over ceasar salad an it was perfect.  Salmon was perfectly cooked, with a little crisp on the outside from the grill, just how I like it.  Hubby had the fish an chips and it was delicious.  Batter was good and crispy.  The portions are decent. The price is a little high, but I think its worth it because the seafood seems very fresh. 

I would totally come back here again.", "Had an amazing Lunch at Bennett's on sunday. down at Ocean Shores for the Beach Fun Festival. I had the Chicken Cranberry Cashew feta salad - better even than it sounds and it was so big, I had to take half home with me. My partner had the fish taco...they usually served it with battered fried cod - but Randi the owner said they would make it grilled per customer request. There was a cashier/waitperson (can't remember his name, unfortunately ) who greeted us - gave us recommendations, came to check how his recommendations tasted and even chatted for a few minutes. He is a senior in high school in Seattle and goes to Ocean Shores to work on the weekends. ......Made us feel very welcomed.......The Bar was equally friendly and had my favorite"Manny's on Tap"...$4.50 for a tall, icy pint..........Highly recommend you make a trip down to Ocean Shores ............", "Wow!!! I don't know what happened to this place. Last Oct 2012 it was awesome now it stinks. Dropped almost $50 on 2 battered cod combos. the fish was severely over cooked and dripping with grease, clam strips were so over cooked they were like eating rubber bands and the fries were soggy with grease from the fish to the point of being not edible. I'm done with Bennett's", "They make a tasty bacon burger. pricey but tasty none the less.", "Great crab cakes, good fish and chips. Nice selection of beer and cocktails.
We found the service friendly! Thank goodness another restaurant choice other than
Viet hoa now in ocean shores with good food!", "Good food, friendly service!", "Certainly on a par with Ivar's fish & chips take-out in Seattle. Cole slaw is very good. Only problem I had was the service was a little slow - 26 minutes to get fish & chips from the time stamp on the receipt to at my table.", "Don't come here when you're hungry. Ridiculous long wait. We ordered a bacon burger, halibut sandwich, and a bloody mary. The girl said it would be delivered to our table. After 30 mins and still no sign of food or my drink. I decided to check on my drink and the girl said I are suppose to pick it up in the lounge....Well why didn't you tell me that in the beginning???? After 20 more mins....still no sign of food (total 50 mins since we ordered). I went up again to ask, note there were others who also have the same problem waiting for their foods too. 
Finally after close to an hour wait we finally got our food. Food was nothing special and wait staff was rude. Will not come back", "Maybe I'm crazy, but there's not much in Ocean Shores.  We were looking for a place to eat and Bennett's was right across the convention center i was having a conference at. DH said "Let's go there!" So, we did -- it was one of the best impromptu decisions we made that trip -- we ate there every day over the course of our trip. 

- Staff was super nice. They were very accommodating and friendly. 
- Fish and chips were crispy. I hate soggy Fish and Chips. You know the type where you feel like you could have gotten these frozen from the supermarket? not here. the fish was awesome. 
- The southwestern burger was SUPER good. I loved it. I ordered the fish and chips the first day, my DH ordered the Southwest burger. I snagged his burger and chomped down 4 big bites. Then, I ordered it the next day. 

Downside: 

-The oysters are always sold out! I wanted fried oysters and every day I went in they said they were sold out. This made me sad. If i got back to Ocean Shores again I am getting those oysters!!!", "We went to Ocean Shores over the 4th of July, and decided to have lunch at Bennett's.  They were open at 11am, and serving a nice lunch menu.  The restaurant is laid out nicely, the menu easy to read, the bathroom is clean, and the atmosphere is comfy.  

I ordered the chicken strips basket, served with fries.  I got 4 pieces of chicken, which were juicy... most times, at places where I've ordered this, the chicken is quite dry.  

My wife got their fish taco.  OMG, it was more like a HUGE fish burrito.  She shared half of it with me (and I kindly shared half of my chicken.... we're sweet like that)!  It was really tasty, with a sauce that gave a little hint of spice.  

Others in our party tried their crab cakes, clam chowder, hamburger, and a few other items.  Everyone was happy with their selections and ate all of the food.  There wasn't even a crumb to be found on our table when we were finished (that's a family trait!)!!!

I'd recommend Bennett's to anyone going out to Ocean Shores for a nice lunch, or dinner.", "I fully expected to find nothing but touristy, overpriced fried food in Ocean Shores... when we happened upon this wonderful place. We were flying blind, low on iPhone battery and no access to Yelp.  Gave this place a whirl, and LOVED it!  Fish and chips, fried oysters, and coleslaw were all top notch.  Great service.  Well-mixed drinks.  Nice decor.  Clean, lots of sunlight.  

Only one minor negative... odd women's restroom setup.  Two toilets in one big room with one lock on the door.  So although it wasn't crowded, there was a line for the latrine.

But really, I can easily overlook it in order to enjoy the food and drink and ambiance again.  And again.", "So I was really looking forward to eating in just because I realized how small our hotel room was and I really wanted to escape the cold but as soon as we walked in there was a line and it looked like all tables were taken. 

You would think it's a regular restaurant where a server serves you but apparently it's one of those places where you get in line at the front and you order at the cash register and then try to find an empty table and they bring the food to you?

I suck at waiting. I get bored and start doing weird stuff so I suggested we just do a take out order and eat in our small but warm hotel room. I get the battered shrimp combo, boyfriend gets cod and my six year old gets the chicken tenders. Young lady at the register tells us it'll take at least 40 minutes for the food to be done and I almost thought about going elsewhere but we decide to wait. 

I'm glad I waited. Everything was better than I thought it'd be which is always a plus since I always expect the worst in stuff. It's my optimistic nature working overtime ;)

The fries are seasoned and cooked perfectly; not at all soggy like I thought to-go fries would be. I tried my son's chicken tenders and even that is good since I usually stay away from fried food.

My shrimp came with a tartar sauce and some kinda cocktail sauce which were amazing! It had a hint of horseradish to it which gave it this nice extra kick and definitely stood out. If they bottled their sauce and sold it in stores I would def buy!

Food was greasy but not that bad kinda greasy that makes your stomach rumble and you feel like the grease is traveling through your veins and your brain is calling you a fat ass and then five minutes later you have to say hi to the toilet. It was grease in a good-can't-stop-eating kinda way. My shrimp was battered perfectly and not all soggy and weird. They were a nice size and juicy.

Boyfriends cod was soft and flaky and for someone that doesn't like fish and chips too much I definitely enjoyed his. 

Everything surpassed expectations. Will be back.", "Best new place in ocean shores. We visit the ocean several times a year and discovered this fabulous place last visit.  We have had the; fish tacos, chowder, crab melt and chicken/cranberry salad.  All dishes were amazing, big portions prepared in a contemporary way.

This is a must if you are going to ocean shores!", "Wow, Ocean Shores is kind of a dump. I was expecting quaintness a la some of the little towns on the Oregon Coast. The shark-themed store didn't even have a shark costume for my dog, major disappointment. 

Anyway. We drove through Ocean Shores en route to Lake Quinault and after frolicking on the beach, wanted some lunch. This place looked like a decent option and it delivered. Delicious fried seafood options galore, good fries, and a boatload of tartar sauce to drown it in. Thank you, Washington State, for bringing the glorious combo of tartar sauce + fries to my life.", "We didn't have too many food options on a Thursday night in March, but after reading the great reviews of this place, we decided to swing on by.  I liked the coastal pub/restaurant feel after first walking in the door and we were greeted immediately by a friendly woman who told us our options.  We decided to sit in the bar.

The bartender was friendly and made a delicious bloody mary for me.  I love a good homemade bloody mary.  The pickled veggies that they serve with it are quite tasty as well.  My friend got a beer and they had a really good selection on tap.

I ordered the crab cakes, which were supposedly famous.  $12.95 for two.  They were on the smaller side for crab cakes, but they were ALL dungeness crab meat and none of that breading filler that many places use.  Definitely flavorful and priced just right.

Friendly staff, an inviting atmosphere, and decent food.  I'd go back.", "I really love the ambiance of this new restaurant, but I'm not a big fan of the Halibut & Chips. The fish tasted really fresh, but the batter was bland. Maybe I'm just spoiled living in Seattle and having access to Spud's and Ivar's. Someone at a nearby table ordered the Cod & Chips, which looked way better. I'll have to try that next time.

Some other people in my dining party ordered the wrap, which they said was delicious. I heard the fish tacos were okay. When my friend took them home and added lime juice, they were apparently 10 times better. 

Another person at our table ordered a bacon cheeseburger, which looked AMAZING. He loved it. 

So a mixed review from our large party - some loved their food, some thought it was okay. No one disliked their meal.", "Very good food!  Kind of expensive, but not too bad.  Cute bar area.  Very nice bartender/server.", "Fish Taco on a GF tortilla was MAGICAL and the French fries (chips) are GF as well. Hubby had halibut and chips and the little one had the kids fish basket. Everything was great! 

The owner came out and met us and we chatted a while (very nice! And very proud of his hard work put into this place - there are two other locations in different cities, we will be visiting those too) and he took us to the kitchen for a tour. THE CLEANEST KITCHEN EVER! He spoke about offering more GF items soon.

You HAVE to try this place.", "was looking for a good seafood place before Razor Clam dig. Came in based on the reviews and the reviews are spot on. 
PROS:
1. Hands down the BEST fried clams I have ever had. delish!!
2. Hands down the BEST Fish & Chips I have ever had. The Cod was incredibly fresh, sweet and moist. Nice large pieces. 
3. Fried Prawns was very good. 
4. Beer Batter is VERY good, probably the best I have ever tried (and I have lived on both coasts). Not heavy, great flavor, not nasty/greasy. 
5. Heard from someone in group (who got a complimentary cup of chowder) that the Clam Chowder was VERY good. 

CON: 
1. Why does a place like this (that is so good but out in NOWHEREVille) have to charge such high prices? I mean $14.00 for Halibut & Chips (and you get only two pieces!) is a bit outrageous! We ended up spending $40.00 on Clam/chips, F&C and Prawn/chips. ouch.", "My review comes with a disclaimer that I have a high school friend that works here and brags about how awesome this place is. This means, I have a slight bias. 

Friend aside, my fiance's family and I went here twice during our weekend stay in Ocean Shores. Both times, I ordered the fish taco and both times I was enamored by how delicious (and huge) the tacos were. Others ordered fish and chips, halibut sandwiches, and other stuff I can't remember. Not one person had a complaint about the food. 

I found the kitchen staff to be efficient and we never had an excessive wait for the food. That said, it was all quite fresh anyway. The counter staff are polite and knowledgeable about the product they sell. 

The cost is a bit pricey but you get a huge quantity of food. Overall, even if friend didn't work here, I would still go back.", "here is a brief rundown.  i try to make them all brief, but it never happens. 

came in for dinner.  i had a cup of chowder and the caesar.   chowder was good, i needed a little extra salt though.  ceasar was good, a little too cheesy for me.  my dad and brother had the cod and the batter was too greasy.  the beer was cold so that's a plus.  the group (softball girls and parents we were with came in about 10 minutes before closing ) and bennett's served them which i thought was really nice.  could have gone the other way.   i also heard the fish taco was delish.  it was HUGE..when i read fish taco (singular) i was like..what a rip, but after seeing it, they should actually say fish burrito and not cause people like me confusion and anger. 

if i ever find myself in ocean shores again, i would go to bennett's. 

also, if you're a lady, let me know what you think of the bathroom.  it's a 1 person bathroom...but there are two toilets...facing each other with no door....awkward.", "In my opinion, this place is WAY overpriced. Fried seafood and fries for two, one bowl of clam chowder, and two beers were about $50. The bartender was friendly, but his incessant whistling was very irritating. Like nails on a chalkboard.

In the end, if the food had been good, I could have overlooked the cost and the whistling, but it wasn't. The chowder had very few clams, and was in desperate need of cream. Very potato-y. The fried clams were quite chewy, although some of them were amazingly tasty and tender, so I couldn't send them back. The fries were excellent, as was the tartar sauce. But good fries and good tartar sauce does not a return trip make...sorry.", "Stopped in here for lunch.  We usually go to Alac's but wanted to give it a try.   The food was only okay.  I had The Cod and chips was good.  My wife had the Halibut.  It was a few dollars more and was not very good.  It tasted like something I could buy in a box.  The fillet was very thin and lacked flavor.  The fries were really good and the clam chowder was a little watery.  The reason they only get two stars is that the service was horrible.  That lady at the front counter was rude and seemed annoyed that we were even there.  Also, there were no substitutions allowed.  I tried to get a salad or cup of chowder instead of fries and the lady looked at me like I was an idiot.  Sorry guys I won't be coming back to Benetts anytime soon.  Really to bad because the place looks nice and it seems like people like it.", "We had noticed this place the last couple of times we were out here in Ocean Shores and kept promising ourselves that we'd give it a try. Well, this weekend was it.

We both liked the ambiance; family style, sort of 'self-serve', but with a separate bar for the adults.

I chose the fried fresh oysters and fries platter with a side of coleslaw  and Bee had the fried halibut platter with a side of clam chowder. We were both favorably impressed with the size of the servings. Good portions of fish and not too many fries (which came cheerfully unsalted).

It being our first time there we didn't quite understand that the onus of getting the napkins, silverware and drinks was on us, but now that we know, we're both cool with it. (an aside from the order-taker person would have been helpful).

The fish, oysters, fries, and chowder arrived piping hot and the coleslaw was nicely chilled. The chowder appeared to be home made, big chunks of potato and celery and topped with a daub of butter. Very tasty!

Partway through the meal the owner stopped by the table and asked if everything was to our satisfaction. He also asked how we had heard about the place. We said we were 'drive-by' customers.

All in all a very nice meal.", ""Saturday afternoon June 30 we were very hungry and thought this looked like a great place for lunch. Never again! Slow service, 45 min wait for a cheeseburger and a fish sandwich and we still had not received our food. This is very sad for a restaurant that was not that busy. It took almost 50 min for lunch to arrive. The food was ok, but not for the time it took and the price we paid."", "On a mini-vacation in Ocean Shores last weekend my better half found this place on Yelp and boy am I glad we tried it. The prices are reasonable, the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the food is great. You can choose to order and pay at the counter in the main dining room or you can opt for full wait service in the bar. Either way is a win because the food is awesome! 

Let me start by saying how much I love crab cakes. If a restaurant has crab cakes on the menu, I'm going to try them. Usually, I'm disappointed by an abundance of filler. Not at Bennett's! The menu describes their crab cakes as "famous" and they certainly should be. As soon as I cut into the perfectly crisped cake I knew there would be no disappointment. Crab, crab and more crab are what you see and what you taste. The seasoning is on point, there is a wonderful sauce drizzled on top and the sides of pico de gallo and sliced avocado round out the flavors beautifully. Just wonderful! 

OK, now that I'm done swooning over the crab cakes, let's move on. First, awesome french fries! Seriously! Cut about a 1/2 inch thick they are perfectly golden brown, super crispy and light and fluffy on the inside. Just exactly what french fries should be. The battered cod is also super tasty with a golden brown, puffy and crunchy outside and moist, tender fish inside. My one gripe is that I wish the oil had been blotted off a little better. The tasty  tartar sauce is perfect with the fries and fish so get some! The house made raspberry lemonade is tart and sweet and perfect mixed with some 7 Up as the very friendly staff will suggest. 

All in all a great place to eat, so we went twice!", "Was in Ocean Shores 7/31-8/3 and I saw the pretty good reviews compared to all the other food establishments.  Conviently near the main beach strip, we decided to have lunch since we have been eating in.  I was determined to try the Chowder and  I always try the Fish & Chips in most restaurants.  All was delicious, but my only thought that it was a bit pricey since we paid about $32 with lemonade.  Oh well, we are in tourist trap!", "What a great surprise!   We'd written off most of the food in Ocean Shores as awful... so we stepped through the doors at Bennett's with a good deal of Hesitation.   But they proved us wrong!    Best food of the whole trip!  

I'd recommend Bennett's to anyone visiting Ocean Shores.   I had the Crab Cakes and my friends had the Fish Tacos.   Everyone got the amazing french fries! 

Great food, decent atmosphere, clean and GREAT SERVICE!", "I would highly recommend this place and would go back next time I'm at Ocean 
Shores.  Fresh delicious food and the portions were huge for a very reasonable price.  My brother and sister-in-law both had the Bennett special which included a sandwich, chowder and a salad - they couldn't finish it (my brother has a hearty appetite!).  I had the crab cakes and chowder - DELICIOUS!  Even the burger that my father ordered did not skimp on the burger.  The tempura prawns were huge and needed to be shared with the rest of the family.
The wait service were extremely kind and patient with us because we kept asking for this and that.", "It's a shame that Ocean Shores doesn't have any really good seafood restaurants.  Having said that, Bennetts has some of the best food in town. I had the crab cakes, and my sweetie had the " Best" combo - crab sandwich, salad and chowder.  The crab cakes were delicious, with lots of crab and very little filler.  The chowder was tasty, but only lukewarm.
The decor is nicer than you'd expect, sort of classy roadhouse.  There is full service in the small bar area; otherwise you order at the counter.  
This place isn't cheap, but the food is good and the waitstaff were friendly.  It's not up-scale, but it is good.", "This place doesn't look like much from the outside, which seems to be the trend in Ocean Shores, but was surprisingly spacious & well decorated in the inside. We went on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM & the place was crazy packed. We had the clam chowder where the texture resembled more like mashed potatoes with a big glob of butter in the middle, not such a fan. However, the crab melt and COD fish & chips were delish! We'll be back when we're in the area.", "As an Ocean Shores restaurant I want to say "go home, ya blubbering tourists!!!"

Kidding...(sorta)

Bennett's has the best burgers in town, for the only 2 that they make. The fish & chips are excellent as well (dare I say the best in town). The food here is great and reasonable, but the menu could stand some variety. The bar has a wide variety of beers and all are fairly reasonably priced. Also, the place looks nice, which is a breath of fresh air. It's nice to see a new joint in town that doesn't have the same recycled decor as the last 3 places that were there before it folded.", "Considering that this is a seafood place, it was pretty sad that the best item here was their fries. Everything we ordered came out really bland. We ordered the crab cakes, halibut sandwich, fish "tacos" and a small clam chowder. The crab cakes were made of real crab meat but they were very bland! The halibut sandwich was pretty good. The fish tacos were not really tacos - they were actually burritos!! (see picture I posted) It tasted a little bitter too. The clam chowder was pretty good. However, based on our overall experience, we will never come back here.", "Really Really liked this place

Lots of parking, good cheery staff.

They bring out the food to you, but you have to get your own silverware/drinks, so it is kind of self serve.

I had the Bennett's best, which is a portion of the cranberry salad, a crab melt sandwich and a cup of clam chowder.  The crab was really good and chunky in the  sandwich, and the Cranberry chicken salad was really refreshing.   The clam chowder had large chunks of potatoes and good sized clams and tasted really good.

I'm just glad there is another option to eat out at in Ocean Shores!", "Nice venue, friendly staff, mouth watering raspberry lemonade greets you as you step into line (tip: mix lemonade with a little 7up...you won't regret it!)

Limited menu, but nice variety of fish (obviously). As a non fish eater ( yes, I know don't belong here and understand the irony), there are only a couple choices (one of which is the kid's menu). However, there are both some veggie and gluten-free options. (my pescatarian friends say the batter your fish order, so you can get without batter if you like!)", "Overpriced and nothing special.  Next time we are in this area, we will probably try to find something else.  

We came here on a pretty crowded Sunday for lunch.   The ambiance is clean, new and casual

We ended up waiting 40 minutes for our food, which cost us over $64 for 

(i) 4 entrees (fried clam strips, fried halibut, fried oysters and bacon cheeseburger), 

(ii) 1 bowl of clam chowder and 

(iii) 2 soft drinks. 

Most of the seafood entrees are fried, which was a bit disappointing.  (They were out of the crab cakes at 1230 p.m.!) I found the clam used in the fried clam strips to be chewy and not that fresh.   The gooey consistency of the clam chowder reminded me something that comes out of a Campbell.  

However, my husband and son loved the bacon cheeseburger and fried halibut.", "Got the "best of the best" special. The meal was pretty good size for the price of $13.99. The Crab sandwich was good, I might get it as an open face sandwich next time. The salad was excellent with cranberries and cashews. And the clam chowder was deeeelish! Very clammy, which I love. And the space is very well designed and clean. Good choice if you're looking for dinner and a drink.", "I had the halibut sandwich and it was incredible, very flavorful. The fries are the best! The skin is left on and not too soggy and not dried out. My girlfriend had the cod and chips and she loved it. We shared a small cup of clam chowder and it was literally the best clam chowder I've ever had. We almost didn't go in because it looked a bit like a roadhouse or some bar but im very glad we did! Clean establishment with a friendly staff. Definitely recommend.", "We ordered at the counter and sat down at the table. Your order was brought to us. You can also have full service at the bar. Fried oysters was good but we had better. Battered cod was pretty good. The meat was firm and the portion was generous (3 big pieces). Dungeness crab cake was the best. It was 90% crab meat chunks. Delicious! All three plates came with French fries. Staff was all friendly.",
"Food & service was awesome!  Great addtion to Ocean Shores!!", "Nice place, good customer service. Food was . . . Ok, but pricey.", "Husband and I ordered the Cheeseburger, kinda pricey - but the best burger ever.  Don't mind paying higher price for good food.

Staff friendly and helpful.  Restaurant was clean and neat.  Will be back!!!!!", "My wife & I have eaten lunch here several times over the past year & it's always been good.  I always get the halibut & chips with a cup of chowder & my wife gets the clam strips. Always very consistent in the way they prepare their food.", "Everything we had was delicious! Servings were generous, too. I liked the fact that the bar was enclosed, which helped to maintain a more family-friendly atmosphere.", "Every time we go to Ocean Shores we make it a priority to eat at Bennett's Fish Shack.  The fish and chips are great and the portion size is beyond filling.", "After visiting the Bennett's restaurant in Grayland, WA (where we had an outstanding meal) a few months ago, we decided to try Bennett's Fish Shack in Ocean Shores on a recent Friday night. There was a long line at the order counter and no open tables, so we left and came back a little while later. Same scenario, but we decided to order and hoped a table would become available. We were able to secure a table and waited a reasonable amount of time for our food to arrive. What a disappointment! Our family of four all orered the same meal: halibut and chips. The fish didn't taste fresh and the batter was bland. Fries were served with cocktail sauce, which threw us off as we were expecting the "red sauce" to be catsup. Easily remedied but seemed odd. Dinner was pricey ($75.00) for what it was. Next time when we want halibut and chips, we'll go to The Breakwater in nearby Aberdeen.", "Unbelievably GREAT.
Staff was so curteous-- the place is spotless and all food was fresh to order.
I had the fish and chips and a glass of their Iced Green Tea that is self serve and I could have all I could drink. This place needs to feed the Royalty- I will be back, nothing else can compare, I here thre are 2 other locations too- YUM!", "Great little fish place at The Shores. Ask for your chowder at the counter because it will be awhile until the order shows up. Good food all around. Two visits with six fussy eaters and all were thumbs up.", "I swear my cod must have been swimming this morning...FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!", "This review has been removed for violating our Content Guidelines or Terms of Services", "This review has been removed for violating our Content Guidelines or Terms of Services", "This review has been removed for violating our Content Guidelines or Terms of Services"];
