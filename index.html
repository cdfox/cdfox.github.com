    <p> I am a computer science Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University working with <a href="http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/keboyer/">Dr. Kristy Boyer</a>. My current research goal is to apply machine learning to build dialogue systems that improve as they interact with users. For my master's thesis, I extended a probabilistic model of topics in documents called Latent Dirichlet Allocation in order to automatically discover how the words associated with a topic (e.g., legal cases) depend on time (e.g., the name of a company involved in an ongoing case).</p>
    <p> Other interests include web deveopment, mobile app development, and coffee.</p>
    <h2> Masters Research </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="topic_table.png">Legal topic table.</a> This is a table from my master's thesis showing the words in a set of news articles and blog posts related to "legal cases" in each of several weeks.

    <p>
      <a href="lda_gibbs_js/gibbs.html"> Gibbs sampling animation</a>. This is an animation of collapsed Gibbs sampling for Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
      Documents 0-40 are online reviews for a farmer's market, and 41-81 are online reviews for a Thai restaurant. Common words and punctuation have been removed. There are 2 topics, indicated by green and orange. The assignment of topics to words is initially random but quickly converges so that each topic corresponds to one of the review categories. A good overview of LDA and related models: <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/Blei2012.pdf">link</a>.

    <h2> Undergrad Research </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="branched_polymer/polymer2000.png">2000 disks</a>, <a href="branched_polymer/polymer3000.png">3000 disks</a>, and <a href="branched_polymer/polymer100_increasing_radii.png">100 disks with varying radii</a>. These are branched polymers randomly generated using some code I wrote for an undergraduate research project. I used Sage (Python-based math software). More details about branched polymers: <a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~pw/papers/polymer.pdf">link</a>.

    <h2> Hobbies </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://proxliapp.appspot.com">Proxli</a>. A geolocation-based anonymous message board. The purpose was to experiment with the HTML5 geolocation API. Looks better on a phone.

      <a href="canvas_mines/canvas_mines.html">Canvas Minesweeper.</a>
      An HTML Canvas version of the classic Windows game.
