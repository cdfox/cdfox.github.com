<h1> MapDrive </h1>

<p>Objective: The tutor attempts to teach the driver a route. The tutor can see the route on his or her map and writes textual instructions to the driver through the chat interface. The driver sees a blank map and can draw on the map by holding the shift key while moving the cursor. The current state of the driver's map is synced to the tutor's map is realtime. The driver can clear the map to start a new session using the "New Session" button. </p>
